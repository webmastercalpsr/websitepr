              Hi there! <br /><br />
              I am Claire Bogen, and I am thrilled to serve as your Recruitment Chair this Fall. 
              I hope you'll come to love this incredible community of women as much as I do!<br /><br />
              Having gone through recruitment myself, I understand how daunting it can seem at first. I'm here 
              for each and every one of you, aiming to make this process as comfortable and exciting as possible. 
              Every sister of Phi Rho is eagerly anticipating meeting all members of this Fallâ€™s recruiting class. 
              My goal is to help you foster meaningful connections with us!<br /><br />
              I can't wait to meet you in person during the recruitment process! I promise it will be a fulfilling 
              experience of exploration and self-discovery. If you have any questions about recruitment or Phi Rho in
              general, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at recruitment.calpsr@gmail.com. Be sure to follow us
              on Instagram @calphirho for updates. <br /><br />
              Looking forward to connecting with you soon!<br /><br />
              Phi Rho Love, <br /><br />
              Claire <br />
